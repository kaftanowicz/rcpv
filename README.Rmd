# rcpv

R package for working with Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes. As described on [SIMAP](https://simap.ted.europa.eu/cpv "information system for public procurement (fr. système d'information pour les marchés publics)"):

> The CPV establishes a single classification system for public procurement aimed at standardising the references used (...) to describe the subject of procurement contracts.

> The CPV consists of a main vocabulary for defining the subject of a contract, and a supplementary vocabulary for adding further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit) associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services forming the subject of the contract.

## Installation

To install directly from GitHub:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("kaftanowicz/rcpv")
```

## Usage

The main function exported by this package is `describe_cpv`, which repairs given CPV codes if they are broken, classifies them at selected level of aggregation and returns their description in chosen language, shortened to desired number of characters.

```{r example_1}
cpv <- c("45212212-5", "34962220-6", "15961100-3")

describe_cpv(cpv)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 5)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 4)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 3)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 2)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 1)
describe_cpv(cpv, class_level = 1, max_nchar = 30)

describe_cpv(cpv, lang = "DE")
```

Several of the functions called inside `describe_cpv` - `is_correct_cpv`, `correct_cpv`, `classify_cpv`, `convert_cpv`, `shorten_cpv`, `shorten_desc` -  are available to the user on their own.
```{r example_2}
cpv <- c("45212212-5", "45212212  - 5", "452122125", "45.21.22.12.5")

is_correct_cpv(cpv)

correct_cpv(cpv)
```

```{r example_3}
cpv <- "45.21.22.12.5"
classify_cpv(cpv, class_level = 1)
```

```{r example_4}
cpv_2003 <- "01111000-8"
(cpv_2007 <- convert_cpv(cpv_2003, from2003to2007 = TRUE))
convert_cpv(cpv_2007, from2003to2007 = FALSE)
```

```{r example_5}
li <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"
shorten_desc(li, max_nchar = 30, ending = "...")
```
